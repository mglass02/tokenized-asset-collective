  <main>
    <p>Real estate has long been a foundation of global wealth creation, yet traditional investment models often suffer from high entry costs, complex transactions, and limited liquidity. In 2025, tokenization is reshaping this landscape by transforming physical properties into blockchain-based digital tokens. This evolution enhances accessibility, efficiency, and transparency across the sector.</p>

    <h2>How Real Estate Tokenization Works</h2>
    <p>Through tokenization, ownership rights—such as equity, rental income, or profit shares—are represented by digital tokens recorded on blockchain networks. These tokens can be programmed with smart contracts to automate processes like income distribution or compliance checks.</p>

    <p>For example, a $5 million commercial property could be divided into 50,000 tokens, each representing a fractional share of ownership. This approach makes investment more flexible and inclusive while maintaining verifiable ownership records on-chain.</p>

    <h2>Core Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fractional Ownership:</strong> Investors can buy shares as small as $100 in premium properties, diversifying portfolios without massive upfront costs. For instance, a $5 million commercial building could be divided into 50,000 tokens, making it accessible to retail investors.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Liquidity:</strong> Unlike traditional sales that take months, tokens trade 24/7 on global markets, reducing holding periods and enabling quick exits. This addresses the illiquidity that plagues real estate assets worldwide.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong> Blockchain eliminates borders; a U.S. investor can easily acquire tokens in European real estate without complex legal hurdles, tapping into emerging markets like Asia's growing property sector.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency and Security:</strong> Every transaction is recorded on-chain, minimizing fraud. Smart contracts automate rent distributions, ensuring timely payouts with audit trails that build investor trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages for Developers and Property Owners</h2>
    <p>Developers can leverage tokenization to raise funds more efficiently by selling fractional interests rather than relying solely on institutional financing. Property owners gain flexibility, as tokens can represent equity stakes or future revenue rights that are easily transferable or tradable.</p>

    <h2>Comparing Traditional vs. Tokenized Real Estate</h2>
    <table class="choice-table" summary="Comparison of traditional and tokenized real estate">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Aspect</th>
          <th>Traditional Real Estate</th>
          <th>Tokenized Real Estate</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Entry Cost</td>
          <td>High (entire property purchase)</td>
          <td>Low (fractional ownership)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Liquidity</td>
          <td>Limited (slow sales cycles)</td>
          <td>Improved (faster token trades)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Accessibility</td>
          <td>Regional or local</td>
          <td>Global participation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Transparency</td>
          <td>Dependent on intermediaries</td>
          <td>Blockchain-based and verifiable</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>The Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>As technology and regulations evolve, tokenization is expected to become a standard model for fractional property ownership. Integration with emerging frameworks and digital identity systems will enable compliant, secure, and scalable real estate investment ecosystems worldwide.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Real estate tokenization opens the door to more inclusive, efficient, and transparent investment opportunities. By lowering entry barriers and increasing liquidity, it redefines how individuals and institutions engage with one of the world’s oldest asset classes.</p>
