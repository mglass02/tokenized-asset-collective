  <main>
    <p>While real estate tokenization promises efficiency, accessibility, and liquidity, its widespread adoption still faces multiple challenges. In 2025, regulatory uncertainty, technical vulnerabilities, and market immaturity remain the primary hurdles that must be carefully managed to ensure sustainable progress.</p>

    <h2>Regulatory and Compliance Challenges</h2>
    <p>Real estate tokens often fall under existing securities laws, requiring compliance with strict frameworks that vary across jurisdictions. Meeting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements can be resource-intensive, and cross-border trading introduces additional complexity when navigating international regulations.</p>

    <h2>Technical and Security Risks</h2>
    <p>Blockchain immutability ensures trust, but it also means that coding errors or security flaws can result in irreversible consequences. Smart contract bugs, oracle failures, and wallet breaches are ongoing risks that must be mitigated through audits and best practices.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smart Contract Audits:</strong> Rigorous testing and multiple independent code reviews are essential to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Reliability:</strong> Oracles providing property valuation and off-chain data must be diversified to reduce dependency risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Strong custody standards, encryption, and user education can protect against theft or phishing attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Market and Adoption Limitations</h2>
    <p>Secondary markets for tokenized real estate are still developing, which limits liquidity and price discovery. Public perception remains cautious, as many associate blockchain assets with volatility or speculation. Education and transparent governance models are crucial to building trust among institutional and retail participants alike.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Mitigation</h2>
    <p>Organizations exploring tokenization can mitigate these challenges through a structured approach:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Legal Preparedness:</strong> Work closely with regulatory experts to ensure compliance with local and international securities laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Resilience:</strong> Adopt secure development standards, run penetration tests, and implement multi-signature authorization for transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Infrastructure:</strong> Partner with licensed exchanges and custodians to foster liquidity and compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Investor Education:</strong> Communicate clearly about risks, rights, and mechanisms of tokenized ownership to promote confidence and adoption.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Tokenization of real estate represents a major innovation, but realizing its full potential depends on responsible execution. By anticipating and addressing regulatory, technical, and market risks early, organizations can establish a strong foundation for the future of tokenized property markets.</p>
