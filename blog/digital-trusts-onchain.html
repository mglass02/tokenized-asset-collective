  <main class="blog-content">
    <p>The digital transformation of estate planning is entering a new phase — one where blockchain-based digital trusts replace paper-heavy, intermediary-driven legacy systems. These programmable trusts store assets, beneficiaries, and execution conditions directly on-chain, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring transparent fulfillment of the grantor’s intent.</p>

    <p>In traditional trusts, execution often depends on third-party administrators or court oversight. Blockchain replaces this with smart contracts — automated, immutable instructions that distribute assets based on predefined conditions such as time, age, or specific triggers. For instance, a digital trust can be programmed to release a tokenized real estate share once a beneficiary reaches adulthood or completes education milestones.</p>

    <p>Beyond automation, digital trusts enhance **security and continuity**. Since ownership records are cryptographically linked to the blockchain, tampering is virtually impossible. Executors and beneficiaries can verify trust data instantly without intermediaries, significantly reducing disputes and costs.</p>

    <p>As estate planners, trustees, and family offices adopt tokenization, the digital trust will become the standard — not just for efficiency, but for **trust by design**.</p>
