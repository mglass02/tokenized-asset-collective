  <main>
    <p>Tokenization has moved beyond theory. In 2025, it’s a practical framework reshaping how industries issue, trade, and manage real-world assets (RWAs). What began as an experiment in digital art has become an institutional conversation about ownership, liquidity, and governance.</p>

    <h2>Real Estate: Turning Property Into Programmable Value</h2>
    <p>Real estate was one of the first industries to see real traction. By tokenizing property shares, developers can fractionalize ownership — allowing investors to buy into assets that were once inaccessible.</p>

    <p>Tokens can represent rental income rights, property shares, or even co-ownership governance. Platforms now enable global investors to participate in a local property market — bringing liquidity to what was once a static asset class.</p>

    <h3>Example Use Case</h3>
    <p>A real estate investment firm issues 1,000 tokens representing a luxury apartment building. Investors receive monthly on-chain distributions and can trade ownership on secondary markets, all governed by smart contracts tied to regulatory compliance.</p>

    <h2>Public Companies: Shares That Settle in Seconds</h2>
    <p>Equity markets are also adapting. Tokenized shares can represent public or private equity positions, allowing for faster settlements, automated dividends, and more direct shareholder engagement.</p>

    <p>Beyond speed, tokenized equity can streamline cap table management and open new global investor pools — without the frictions of legacy clearing systems.</p>

    <h2>Government & Governance: Transparent Systems, Real Accountability</h2>
    <p>Governments and DAOs are experimenting with tokenized voting systems — not as speculative tools, but as governance infrastructure.</p>

    <p>By issuing verifiable tokens representing voting rights, municipalities and organizations can enable secure, auditable decision-making without sacrificing privacy.</p>

    <p>In some cases, tokenization also allows for more dynamic forms of representation — weighted voting, time-based influence, or participation-linked governance models.</p>

    <h2>Commodities: Liquidity for Tangible Goods</h2>
    <p>From gold to carbon credits, commodities are being tokenized to reduce settlement time and increase transparency. A gold bar or carbon certificate can now be verified and traded on-chain, ensuring authenticity and eliminating redundant intermediaries.</p>

    <p>For commodity traders, tokenization brings instant settlement and 24/7 liquidity to markets that used to rely on weeks of paperwork.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Processes: Shareholder Meetings, Dividends, and Beyond</h2>
    <p>Tokenization also simplifies the back-office. Shareholder voting, dividend distribution, and access control are increasingly executed through smart contracts. The result: fewer administrative costs and higher transparency for all participants.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Tokenization isn’t confined to one sector — it’s a design principle spreading across industries. Wherever value, ownership, or participation exists, tokenization can make it more fluid, programmable, and global.</p>

    <p>The next decade won’t be about whether industries adopt tokenization — but how deeply they integrate it into their economic DNA.</p>
