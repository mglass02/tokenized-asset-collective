  <main>
    <p>Supply chains are fertile ground for tokenization because they combine provenance, rights, and financial flows. But turning traceability into tradable value requires careful engineering — data integrity, custody of physical assets, and alignment of incentives across many stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>From Traceability to Tokenized Rights</h2>
    <p>Tracking the movement of a container is useful. Tokenizing ownership of a shipment is transformative. A token can represent a bill of lading, a warehouse receipt, or a freight-forwarding milestone — and that token can then be used as collateral, sold to a financier, or split among stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Key Components of a Tokenized Supply Network</h2>
    <h3>Digital twins and IoT</h3>
    <p>Digital twins — anchored by tamper-evident device data — provide the real-time inputs that make a token meaningful. Without reliable sensor feeds (temperature, location, custody events), a token remains an abstraction; with them, it becomes a contractually enforceable instrument.</p>

    <h3>Legal wrappers and interoperability</h3>
    <p>Shipping documents and receivables must be mapped to on-chain attestations. That requires legal models that enforce that an on-chain token corresponds to an off-chain title claim. Effective implementations pair tokens with registries and custodial assurances so market participants can rely on tokenized rights.</p>

    <h2>Finance and Working Capital</h2>
    <p>Tokenization transforms supply chain finance. When receivables are tokenized and discoverable on-chain, lenders can underwrite in near-real time, unlocking working capital for suppliers and reducing borrowing costs. The economics shift — financing moves where data reduces uncertainty.</p>

    <h2>Governance and Incentives</h2>
    <p>Tokenized networks must align incentives across manufacturers, logistics providers, and financiers. Governance tokens for consortium platforms can coordinate dispute resolution, fee schedules, and data sharing policies so that participants share the benefits of increased liquidity.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Lessons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start narrow:</strong> pilot a single asset class, region, or counterparty network rather than a global platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize data integrity:</strong> invest in verifiable IoT and attestation before minting tokens.</li>
      <li><strong>Design for compliance:</strong> embed KYC and transfer rules if tokens will be used as collateral within regulated finance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Tokenizing supply chains isn’t a technology play — it’s an operational redesign. When done well, tokenization replaces friction with new liquidity and better risk allocation. But to deliver that promise, projects must marry sensors, legal structures, custody, and finance into coherent systems that users trust.</p>
