  <main>
    <p>Tokenized capital markets are no longer a theoretical vision — they are a pragmatic re-architecture of issuance, custody, and settlement. Institutions are piloting tokenized funds and debt; clearing and settlement primitives are being rethought; and standards are emerging that put compliance at the heart of design.</p>

    <h2>Why Institutions Are Building On-Chain</h2>
    <p>The primary drivers are efficiency and control. On-chain instruments enable faster settlement, programmable corporate actions, and richer investor experiences — while also opening access to fractional capital and new pools of liquidity. We already see large asset managers experimenting with on-chain funds to provide both primary issuance and secondary liquidity in a single instrument.</p>

    <h2>Tokenized Funds and Debt: Early Production Use Cases</h2>
    <p>Tokenized money market funds and tokenized private credit are the workhorses today. These products keep traditional cashflow profiles but give investors quicker settlement and new settlement rails to move capital 24/7.</p>

    <h2>Standards and Interoperability</h2>
    <p>Standards for permissioned tokens and on-chain registries are critical. By adopting recognized token standards and registries that encode transfer restrictions and KYC status, issuers can ensure a token behaves predictably across custody providers and trading venues.</p>

    <h2>Settlement and the Promise of Atomic Clearing</h2>
    <p>The most disruptive change is settlement itself. Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) workflows that finalize ownership and payment simultaneously — sometimes called atomic settlement — dramatically reduce counterparty credit risk and free up working capital. That is reshaping custody, too: institutions expect custodians to support both on-chain finality and legal reconciliation.</p>

    <h2>Operationalizing Compliance</h2>
    <p>Regulators expect protections that match traditional markets. Tokenized issuance must provide audit trails, reporting, and custody that meet institutional standards. This is why many successful issuances pair smart contracts with legal wrappers and qualified custodians, so that the on-chain flows correspond to enforceable off-chain rights.</p>

    <h2>What Success Looks Like</h2>
    <p>Successful tokenized capital market projects accomplish three things: they automate previously manual processes, they create new liquidity without sacrificing compliance, and they integrate with legacy financial plumbing so institutions can adopt incrementally.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Tokenized capital markets do not represent a lawless frontier; they are an engineering effort to make finance faster, clearer, and more programmable. Institutions that approach tokenization as a matter of operations — not rhetoric — will be the ones that lead the next era of capital markets.</p>
