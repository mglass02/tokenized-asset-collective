    <p>The traditional will has long been a cornerstone of inheritance planning — but it’s also a document vulnerable to interpretation, loss, and delay. Tokenized wills represent the next evolution: a blockchain-native structure where asset distribution rules are embedded directly within smart contracts.</p>

    <p>When an individual’s tokenized will is deployed on-chain, assets such as tokenized property shares, digital securities, or crypto holdings can be automatically transferred to beneficiaries based on verified conditions — such as digital identity confirmation or verified certification of death. This automation not only accelerates asset distribution but also minimizes the legal friction often seen in probate proceedings.</p>

    <p>Tokenized wills are also **interoperable**, capable of interacting with multiple blockchain ecosystems (EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, Polygon, or Base). This ensures that diverse asset types, from tokenized estates to digital currencies, can be unified under a single, automated inheritance framework.</p>

    <p>As jurisdictions modernize digital estate laws, tokenized wills are positioned to become the most **transparent, efficient, and tamper-proof** evolution in inheritance management.</p>
