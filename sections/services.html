      <h2>The Framework</h2>
      <p>Our step-by-step model turns complex inheritance processes into an automated, verifiable on-chain experience.</p>

            <h3>Establish the Trust</h3>
            <p>Create a digital trust that securely holds your digital assets and defines precise inheritance conditions. This becomes the foundation of your estate.</p>

            <h3>Prepare Beneficiaries</h3>
            <p>Each heir sets up a verified wallet, ensuring secure and direct ownership transfer when conditions are met.</p>
