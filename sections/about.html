  <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-cyan-100">
    Tokenized Asset Collective (TAC) exists to help people and businesses understand
    the value of tokenization — the process of turning ownership, access, and participation
    into programmable, digital assets.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-cyan-100">
    Today, TAC is a publication dedicated to thoughtful writing about the future of
    tokenized economies, blockchain systems, and asset digitization.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-cyan-100">
    Tomorrow, TAC will evolve into a research and consulting collective — helping
    organizations design, issue, and manage digital assets responsibly and effectively.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-cyan-100">
    The goal is simple: make the tokenized future understandable, credible, and accessible.
