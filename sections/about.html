    prepare for the future of digital ownership — ensuring that tokenized assets,
    digital estates, and on-chain identities are secured and properly transferred.

    We focus on the intersection of estate planning, digital asset management, and blockchain,
    offering insight and structure to protect what matters most in an increasingly digital world.

  <p class="text-lg text-cyan-100">
    Our mission is simple: to make the next era of wealth — digital, secure, and enduring —
    understandable and accessible for everyone.
