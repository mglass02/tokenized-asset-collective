      <h3>Where It All Began</h3>
      <p>
        It started with a question: <em>“What happens to our digital assets when we’re gone?”</em>
        In an age of tokenized wealth, there was no trusted bridge ensuring that on-chain assets reached
        their rightful heirs. TAC was created to change that.

      <h3>What We’re Building Today</h3>
      <p>
        We’re developing <strong>on-chain estate automation</strong> — a trustless system that ensures
        cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokenized assets are transferred securely to beneficiaries,
        without intermediaries or loss of control.

      <h3>The Future: Bridging Digital and Real Worlds</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond blockchain assets, we’re building frameworks to include
        <strong>Real World Assets (RWAs)</strong> — real estate, equity, and tangible holdings — enabling
        unified estate management across digital and physical domains.

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To establish the world’s first programmable inheritance infrastructure —
        securing every form of value and ensuring what we create today finds its rightful place tomorrow.
