      <h3>About TAC</h3>
      <p>
        Tokenized Asset Collective (TAC) exists to help people and businesses understand
        the value of tokenization — the process of turning ownership, access, and participation
        into programmable, digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, TAC is a publication dedicated to thoughtful writing about the future of
        tokenized economies, blockchain systems, and asset digitization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomorrow, TAC will evolve into a research and consulting collective — helping
        organizations design, issue, and manage digital assets responsibly and effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: make the tokenized future understandable, credible, and accessible.
